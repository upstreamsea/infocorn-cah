                <li class="list-group-item">This game was extensively tested in <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>. It should work in all recent versions of major browsers, but it may not look 100% as intended. If you find a major issue, please <a href="https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy/issues/new">open a bug on GitHub</a> with a screenshot and the name and version of the browser you are using, and I'll try to fix it.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">You may not always see your card in the top area after you play it, but it has been played. Also, sometimes the card will display in the top area but be small. I have no idea why either of these happen.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">If you refresh in the game, an error will pop up in the log briefly before the refresh happens. It is safe to ignore.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">You may see an error after joining a game. As the error message states, this is safe to ignore. I will figure out a way to make this not show up.</li>
